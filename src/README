Donation Widget Generator

There are three steps to make the Donation Widget Generator avialable on 
your website.

1. If you don't already have a Paypal account you must create one at this
time.  You may learn more about Paypal donations and create an account at the
the following url.
  https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/xcl/rec/donate-intro-outside


2. Edit the configuration variables.  You may use any text editor to edit the
Donation Widget Generator script.  The configuration variables are all together 
at the begining of the script.

The only varible you must change is paypal_id, you must enter your Paypal id 
  var paypal_id    = 'payment@example.com'

The item that donator is 'buying'
  var text         = 'Thanks for your Donation' 
Whether donator can submit a note with their donation (true / false)
  var allow_note   = true 

The following four variables are defaults that users may modify using the
Donation Widget Generator.

The dollar amount of the donation in $US
  var amount       = '5.00'
The language of the Paypal pages (one of DE FR IT ES US)
  var language     = 'US'
The button image and its alt text
  var image_url    = 'https://www.paypal.com/en_US/i/btn/x-click-but21.gif'
  var image_alt    = 'Make a donation through Paypal'


3. Include the 'donation-widget_pp.js' script on some page in your website.

There are two methods for including the script.  Neither one is superior.
Depending on how your website is managed one method might be easier than the
other.

Method One:
  Copy the contents of the script and paste them directly into the html of
  your page. The Donation Widget Generator will appear where you paste the 
  script.

Method Two:
  Place the script file somewhere in your html document root.  Then include
  the following in your html pages where you want the Donation Widget
  Generator to appear.  Note: The 'src' must reflect the actual location you
  put the script file.

  <script type="text/javascript" src="/donation-widget_pp.js"></script>
